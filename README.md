## 2-D Roguelike game built in Rust using bracket-lib as game engine

### (based off book [Hands-on Rust](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Rust-Effective-Learning-Development/dp/1680508164/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1JJA3BM3LG23B&keywords=hands-on+rust&qid=1656074550&sprefix=hands-on+rust%2Caps%2C90&sr=8-2))

This is not meant to be anything special but was done in the interest learning how to write more idiomatic Rust code.

Mostly complete and playable (even though as basic as it gets). To play clone, cd into directory, and run
```cargo run```
